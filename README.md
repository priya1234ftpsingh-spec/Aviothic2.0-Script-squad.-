🕵️‍♀️ Lost & Found Hub.....
📘 Project Title:
Lost & Found Hub — A digital platform to help users report and recover lost belongings.

🧩 Project Description:
Lost & Found Hub is a web-based platform built to make it easier for users to report lost items and find found items efficiently.
It provides a centralized digital space to connect the finder and the owner — helping them reconnect quickly and easily.

              💡 “Every lost thing has a story — we’re here to help it find its way back.”

🎯 Problem Addressed & Proposed Solution:
🧠 Problem-
In colleges and public places, students often lose valuable items such as books, ID cards, mobile phones, and wallets.
Traditional ways like notice boards or word-of-mouth are slow, inefficient, and unorganized.

💡Solution...
Our project provides a digital lost and found system where users can:

1: Post details about lost or found items.

2: Search for their belongings using categories or keywords.
3:Contact the finder or owner directly through the platform.
This reduces confusion, saves time, and increases the chances of returning lost items.
